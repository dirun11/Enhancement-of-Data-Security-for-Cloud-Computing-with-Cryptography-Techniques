# Enhancement of Data Security for Cloud Computing with Cryptography Techniques


In the methodology, we have used algorithms like AES, 3DES, and Steganography.
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) uses a substitution permutation technique,
AES is made up of a 128-bit block and keys of various sizes, including 128, 192, and
256 bits. It is made up of a cipher that defines the number of transformation rounds
required to convert plaintext to ciphertext.
It is necessary that the sender and receiver possess the same secret key. Three
categories of information are distinguished: confidential, secret, and top secret. The
systemâ€™s Confidential and Secret levels can be protected by keys of any length. A
key with 192 bits or 256 bits must be used for top-secret material. 256-bit keys have
fourteen rounds, while 128-bit keys have ten rounds and 192-bit keys have twelve
rounds. A round is made up of various processing steps that transform plaintext into
ciphertext.
